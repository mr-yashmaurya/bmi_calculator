# BMI Calculator
  :- A new BMI Calculator App Flutter project.

# Objective:
  :- Create an interactive BMI (Body Mass Index) calculator that makes use of arithmetic operations and
     Flutter UI elements like Slider, Container, Text, etc.
  :- This assignment is focused on helping you understand user interaction, real-time calculations, and
     updating the UI using user inputs. 

# Design a Fun & Interactive BMI Calculator App
  :- Build a Flutter app where users can input their height and weight using sliders or 
     input fields, and then the app calculates and displays the BMI in real-time.

# Requirements:

  1. Use Arithmetic Logic:
    . Apply the formula:
         :- var heightInMetter = heightSlider/100;
         :- var bmi = weight / (heightInMetter * heightInMetter);
    . Update BMI whenever the slider value changes.
 
     
  2. Use Flutter Widgets Creatively:
     :-  Slider for weight and height
     :-  Text widgets to show selected values
     :-  Container to display the calculated BMI
     :-  setState() to dynamically update values


  3. Add Interactivity:
     :- As the user moves the slider, the BMI should update instantly.
     :- Optionally show the BMI category (e.g., Underweight, Normal, Overweight, Obese)

  4. Make It Visually Appealing:
     :- Use background colors or emojis to reflect BMI categories.
